Decription: 
The below quests in UnGoro are bugged whilst partied. If leaving a party the quest can be completed.
The northern pylon
The western pylon
The eastern pylon
How it works: 
When in a party, if trying to activate one of the pylons, nothing will work. If disbandoning from party and attempting, it will work. I have confirmed this with myself and 2 others.

How it should work: 
While partied (and not partied) you should be able to click the pylon to activate it for the quest completion.

Source (you should point out proofs of your report, please give us some source): 

Source is from me playing. It was bugged while I was the right level, I reported it with a GM at the time & had no resolution.. but I realise now it was because I was partied with a friend in another zone. This time, that friend was in ungoro & i was helping, I picked the quests up again to try again. We also invited a random to join us, none of us could activate the pylon. I then kicked the random because he was greedy with loot & he mentioned it worked while unpartied, so we ran back and left group and it worked for us as well. We replicated this with each pylon & it worked each time after leaving party.
